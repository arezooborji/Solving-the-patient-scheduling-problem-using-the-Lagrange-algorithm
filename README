# Solving-the-patient-scheduling-problem-using-the-Lagrange-algorithm
Patient admission planning is a major difficulty in health care resource planning that affects organizational decisions at all levels. The patient admission scheduling problem maximizes treatment efficiency, patient comfort, and hospital utilization while considering all medical limits and patient preferences within a specified timeframe. There are strategic, tactical, and operational patient admission planning issues. This research uses the Bastos 2019 paper model and uses the Lagrange algorithm and a meta-heuristic genetic algorithm to solve it. The results have been reviewed in high dimensions.
